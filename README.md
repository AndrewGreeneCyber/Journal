<h1>Incident handler's Journal</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved documenting and analyzing various cybersecurity incidents in an incident handler's journal. Each entry recorded detailed information about specific incidents, including ransomware attacks, unauthorized executable files, phishing attempts, and data breaches. The journal captured the tools used, detailed descriptions, the 5 W's (Who, What, When, Where, Why), and additional notes on each incident.
